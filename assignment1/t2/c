Fun fact: The first computer bug was an actual bug - a moth trapped in a Harvard Mark II computer in 1947.
Grace Hopper taped it to the logbook with the note "First actual case of bug being found."
Now you're debugging code that moves files between directories. Much less sticky than dealing with moths!
Your implementation better handle files of various sizes without losing any data. Even this rambling text.
